Observations:
A semi-prime number is actually a composite number that only has 3 divisors, 1 and two primes.
Using the same technique for prime factorization, we could calculate the smallest prime divsor for
every composite number in O(N * log(log(N))), which is as same as Sieve Of Eratosthene.
Then, we scan the vector to find out: for each natural number (starting from 2) i, if i divided by its
smallest prime number could generate another prime number. If so, i is a semi-prime number.
Notice it requires at most O(M) to complete all range queries, which means each query should be done in
O(1). In order to achieve this, we need a "prefix sum" like O(N) space to pre-count the number of semi-prime
number ending at natural number i. So for the range query, we then can simply do A[Q[i]]-A[P[i]-1], given
A as such an array.
Well, it took me 81 minutes to figure all this out... :(
